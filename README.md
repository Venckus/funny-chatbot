# Project for class E
Funny chatbot takes user input analyses it and returns funny responses. Kivy framework is used for GUI. Back-end nlp.py package is used for processing.
## Natural language processing concept
The process of natural humans conversations consist of topic as temprary context and usually three general reaction methods:
1. replying in the same topic with some allready received context in order to reflect context is received and understood,
2. replying with some received context to make sure question or topic is understood,
3. changing the topic when it dissolve after pause.
## Features
Some usual chat-bot implementations added:
- `weather` by ip adress and city / location.
- `jokes`.
- In this project all 3 above methods are implemented. But in case to make it more fun simple random rearranging of words is added.
## how to setup
`pip3 install kivy`
