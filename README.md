# Project for class E
Funny chatbot takes user input analyses it and returns funny responses. Kivy framework is used for GUI. Back-end nlp.py package is used for processing.
## Natural language processing concept
The process of natural humans conversations consist of topic as temprary context and usually two general reaction methods:
1. replying in the same topic with some allready received context in order to reflect context is received and understood,
2. replying to questions with some context to make sure it is understood.
## Features
Some usual chat-bot commands added:
- `weather in` by city.
- `tell joke` random jokes about Chuck Norris.
- In this project 2 above methods are implemented. But in case to make it more fun - simple random rearranging of words is added.
## how to setup
To install Kivy libraries used in this project use `pip3 install kivy`. And install requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
